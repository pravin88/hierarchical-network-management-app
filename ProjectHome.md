This is a simple standalone application developed in c# .Net (WPF) for monitoring IP (or DNS) based devices.

The device location can be specified in a map and the devices can be grouped in a hierarchical manner through a tree structure.

Multiple device locations can be saved as a XML file and can be loaded again in to the software.

The device connection status can be updated either manually, or automatically at periodic intervals.
